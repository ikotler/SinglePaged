My name is Itzik Kotler and I'm the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of [SafeBreach](https://www.safebreach.com).
I live in Mountain View, California, with my wife Dana, and our children, Maya and Adam. I have a passion for offensive security and security research.
In my free time, I enjoy playing my electric bass guitar and appreciating Scotch Whiskies.

Sometimes I blog [here](http://blog.ikotler.org). Follow me on Twitter [@itzikkotler](https://www.twitter.com/itzikkotler)
