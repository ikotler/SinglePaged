#### Selected Projects:

- [Hackersh](http://www.hackersh.org) is a free and open source shell (command interpreter) written in Python with Pythonect-like syntax, builtin security commands, and out of the box wrappers for various security tools. It is like Unix pipeline, but for processing security information and metadata rather than bytes. Hackersh is written in Python, and is available under the GPL version 2 or later version. Hackersh is referenced in the [Anti-Hacker Tool Kit, Fourth Edition](https://books.google.com/books?id=NyyvAgAAQBAJ&q=hackersh&dq=hackersh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJh_vW-OvJAhUGdT4KHU1_CNwQ6AEIJDAB)

- [Pythonect](http://www.pythonect.org) is a new, experimental, general-purpose dataflow programming language based on Python. It provides both a visual programming language and a text-based scripting language. The text-based scripting language aims to combine the quick and intuitive feel of shell scripting, with the power of Python. The visual programming language is based on the idea of a diagram with “boxes and arrows”.

- [Pytroj](https://github.com/jgeralnik/Pytroj) is a proof of concept malware that infects Python compiled files (*.pyc). It searches for Python compiled files in a directory and injects itself and a payload into them. Pytroj is written in Python, and is available under the LGPL license v2.1 or later. [Symantec posted a blog entry on Pytroj named "This Python Has Venom!"](https://web.archive.org/web/20121227063247/http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/python-has-venom)

- [Moshi Moshi](https://code.google.com/p/moshimoshi/) is a proof of concept bot that communicates over VoIP. It dial out using SIP protocol and uses DTMF tones as an input and voice (i.e. text-to-speech) as an output. Moshi Moshi is written in Python, and is available under the GPL v3 license. Moshi Moshi has been reviewed and discussed in Chapter 8 of the [Unified Communications Forensics: Anatomy of Common UC Attacks](https://books.google.com/books?id=9lmatCF6L7YC&pg=PA117&dq=MoshiMoshi+Bot&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim8bLu9-vJAhXIbSYKHdTwC8wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=MoshiMoshi%20Bot&f=false)

- [IPPON](https://code.google.com/p/ippon-mitm/) is a tool that uses several techniques of update-exploitation attacks which leverages a man-in-the-middle attack, to build and inject a fake update reply or hijack an on-going update session. IPPON is written in Python, and is available under the GPL v3 license. IPPON has been reviewed and discussed in Chapter 5 of the [Hacking Exposed Wireless, Second Edition book](https://books.google.com/books?source=gbs_search_r&cad=&&ei=e1t_T6CqCIfc9AT-xcTxBw&id=_22wK66-Dh8C&dq=ippon-mitm&q=IPPON#v=onepage&q=IPPON&f=false)
